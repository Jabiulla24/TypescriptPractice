 //Variable Declation

 //WE can use : and then give data type but it is not good practice to give in variable declaration.
 //  By default typescript will check for Typecheck
 let fname: string='John';  //:String is the typecheck 

let userId=555;

let isLogined=true;
 console.log(fname);

//We have one more special Type as "any" if we do not want to use any particular data type then we use any
 let username: any='abc';
 username=444; // In this initial it is defined as string then in this line again it is changed to number

 

 export {}
